Our app is designed for a smarter, safer city. It combines Women’s Safety, Intelli-Traffic, and Pollution Monitoringfeatures. It tracks women’s location during vulnerable hours, sending emergency alerts to nearby contacts and authorities. The Intelli-Traffic system dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on vehicle density, improving flow and reducing congestion. Additionally, it monitors air quality, detects pollution events early, and suggests targeted interventions to promote a healthier, more sustainable urban environment, enhancing overall safety and quality of life in smart cities.
